# Analyzing-Video-with-OpenCV-and-NumPy

Welcome!
Welcome to Analyzing Video with OpenCV and NumPy. This is a project-based course which should take approximately 1 hour to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on five learning objectives:

By the end of task 1, you will be able to read a video file frame-by-frame, and display the frames.
By the end of task 2, you will be able to analyze video frame pixels using NumPy, and modify them.
By the end of task 3, you will be able to convert between different color conventions, and modify video frames using NumPy.
By the end of task 4, you will be able to modify video frames using OpenCV.
By the end of task 5, you will be able to generate a new video file.
By the end of task 6, you will be able to create a collage of images from a movie.
By the end of this course, you will be able to open video files, access the contents frame-by-frame and modify them at the pixel level. The tools you use and skills you develop will be useful in all further video analysis projects using Python.

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
Analyzing Video: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
Project Structure
The hands on project on Analyzing Video with OpenCV and NumPy is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Read a video file frame-by-frame

Task 2: Analyze video frame pixels using NumPy

Task 3: Modifying video frames using NumPy

Task 4: Modifying video frames using OpenCV

Task 5: Generating a new video file

Task 6: Creating a collage of images from a movie

Meet the Instructor
Hi! My name is Daniel and I will be your instructor.

I am very pleased to help you start your journey in video analysis, using powerful tools.

Thank you for choosing this project, I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

About Rhyme
This course runs on Coursera's hands-on platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops that have all the software and data you will need. So, you can just focus on the learning. For this project, this means instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, OpenCV and NumPy pre-installed.

If you need help troubleshooting Rhyme, please refer to the Coursera Help Center for more information.

Earn a Certificate
After you have completed the Analyzing Video hands-on project, you will be able to assess your knowledge using an ungraded assignment. Once you are comfortable with the concepts, take the final quiz, score higher than 80% to earn your certificate.
